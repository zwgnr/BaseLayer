The Potion VScode Extension lies at the heart of PotionUI, powering your project initialization, potion installations, and enabling rapid component creation with code snippets.

*What sets it apart from a CLI tool?*

At the top of the list is efficiency. The extension outpaces any npx TS CLI tools by eradicating the need for temporary downloads and script executions, saving precious time.

But speed is just the tip of the iceberg. The VScode extension leverages the platform's built-in features for an enhanced user experience. It uses the command palette to initialize your project and install potions. Then, it uses the Snippets feature to allow you to create new components from your installed potions, requiring just a few keystrokes.

## Install Extension

Locate and install [PotionUI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap) through the VScode marketplace.

## Commands 

Let's start with the available commands, and how to use them.

To use any of the below commands simply open the command palette in VScode.

```bash
Ctrl+Shift+P
```

### Potion: init

 Automatically configures your project with everything you need. Here's a simplified version of the steps:

  1.  When prompted, enter the folder where you want to initialize PotionUI. If it's in your workspace root, just press Enter. Or, if your project is in a folder called "myproject/frontend," enter "myproject/frontend."

  2.  Select your frontend framework from the options: react, solid, or vue. Confirm your choice.

  3.  The setup process will install the appropriate versions of `@ark-ui/{react/solid/vue}`, `lucide-{react/solid/vue}`, and Tailwind Variants. Your package manager, based on your projectRoot that you set earlier, will be automatically detected.

  4. The setup will automatically configure your global.css and tailwind.config files. It will also create an empty *potions* directory. 

  5. Finally, it will install workspace snippets (in .vscode) of all components in your chosen framework.

That's it! PotionUI is now ready to use in your project.


### Potion: add

This command provies a multi-pick where you can choose one or more potions to install. Upon selection, the `potions.{ts}` files will be automatically created and placed in your potions folder. 

*If you do not have a potions folder set up, and error will be thrown.

### Potion: missing

If you come across a situation where you're using component snippets and realize that you're missing required potions, don't worry! There's a convenient command you can use to resolve this. By running the "missing" command, it will scan the current file you have open and automatically install all the dependent potions to your potions folder.

Simply run the "missing" command whenever you encounter missing dependencies, and PotionUI will take care of the rest.

## Snippets

### Components

PotionUI offers an extensive collection of prebuilt components that you can customize and extend according to your needs. The extension is designed to install local workspace snippets of these components in your chosen framework (React, Solid, Vue) seamlessly.

To access the components, simply use the "pc-" prefix followed by the component name. For example, if you want to use a button, type "pc-button" in your code.
