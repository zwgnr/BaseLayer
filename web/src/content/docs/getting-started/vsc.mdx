The Potion VScode Extension provides snippets of all starter components.

## Install 

Locate and install [potionUI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adpyke.codesnap) in the VScode marketplace.

## Using

All commands are prefixed with "pui". Currently only React components are supported, in the future additional frameworks will be added. *Since solid also uses .tsx file extension the commands for solid will be prefixed with "pui-s".

For example,

```tsx
bui-button
```
will print the below code your editor!

```tsx
import { Pressable as Button } from "@ark-ui/react";
import { buttonPotion } from "@potions/buttonPotion";

<Button className={buttonPotion()}>Button</Button>;
```
