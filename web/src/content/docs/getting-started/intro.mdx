## Forward

Before getting started, it's important to note that Potion is **NOT** a library. It is not a dependency. It is meant to be the building blocks to rapidly create Apps, Component Libraries, and Design Systems.

Potion UI is built on top of Ark UI Primatives, Tailwind CSS, and the Tailwind Variants library. You can read more about how these all fit together in the [Overview](/docs/getting-started/overview) section.

In order quickly init, install potions and access components, PotionUI is powered by a [VScode Extension](/docs/getting-started/vsc). In the future there ideally will be support for other editors such as JetBrains.

**There are two main parts to consider.**

1. Potions (framework agnostic style recipies as .ts files)
2. Starter Components (as VScode snippets) *Currently React only, but Solid and Vue soon.
