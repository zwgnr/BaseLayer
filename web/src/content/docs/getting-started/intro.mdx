Meet Potion UI - a tool for swift and efficient app development, created using the robust foundation of React Aria Component Primitives.

Currently the styling system is handled by Tailwind CSS and the Tailwind Variants library. You can read more about how these fit together in the [Overview](/docs/getting-started/overview) section.

What truly sets Potion UI apart is the inbuilt [VScode Extension](/docs/getting-started/vsc). This is your magic wand to initialize projects, install potions, and access components, all within the familiar environment of VScode. And for those on JetBrains and other platforms, support is hopefully on the horizon.

At its core, Potion UI is comprised of two primary areas:

  1.  The Base layer: These are reusable multi part components with styles.

  2.  Examples: These are ready-made Components available as code snippets right in your VScode editor. They are the implimentation of the assembled base layer components.

Note that Potion is **NOT** a library. It is not a dependency. It is meant to be the building blocks to rapidly create Apps, Component Libraries, and Design Systems.
