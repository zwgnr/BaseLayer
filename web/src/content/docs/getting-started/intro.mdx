Meet Potion UI - a tool for swift and efficient app development, created using the robust foundation of Ark UI Primitives.

Currently the styling system is handled by Tailwind CSS and the Tailwind Variants library. You can read more about how these fit together in the [Overview](/docs/getting-started/overview) section. And, with the imminent release of PandaCSS, you will have another option to choose from instead of Tailwind.

What truly sets Potion UI apart is the inbuilt [VScode Extension](/docs/getting-started/vsc). This is your magic wand to initialize projects, install potions, and access components, all within the familiar environment of VScode. And for those on JetBrains and other platforms, support is hopefully on the horizon.

At its core, Potion UI is comprised of two primary areas:

  1.  Potions: These are reusable style recipes - framework agnostic and conveniently available as .ts files.

  2.  Starter Components: These are ready-made snippets available right in your VScode editor, designed to give you a head start in creating beautiful components. Currently, these are available for React, but rest assured, Solid and Vue are just around the corner!

Note that Potion is **NOT** a library. It is not a dependency. It is meant to be the building blocks to rapidly create Apps, Component Libraries, and Design Systems.
