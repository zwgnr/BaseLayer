Potion UI is built on top of Ark UI Primatives (a headless library). Potion consists of re usuable style recipies (called potions) and also a wide array of starter components created from those potions.

Currently the styling system is handled by Tailwind CSS and the Tailwind Variants library. You can read more about how these fit together in the [Overview](/docs/getting-started/overview) section. 

*Upon its release, PandaCSS as a styling system will be an option as well.

In order quickly init, install potions and access components, PotionUI is powered by a [VScode Extension](/docs/getting-started/vsc). In the future there hopefully will be support for other editors such as JetBrains.

**There are two main parts to consider.**

1. Potions (framework agnostic style recipies as .ts files)
2. Starter Components (as VScode snippets) *Currently React only, but Solid and Vue soon.

Note that Potion is **NOT** a library. It is not a dependency. It is meant to be the building blocks to rapidly create Apps, Component Libraries, and Design Systems.
