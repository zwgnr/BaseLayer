## Forward

Before getting started, it's important to note that Potion is **NOT** a library. It is not a dependency. It is meant to be the building blocks to rapidly create Apps, Component Libraries, and Design Systems.

At the core, PotionUI is a includes a base collection of style recipies called *Potions.* Each Potion is built to fit perfectly with an ARK UI component. From there, those potions are used to build components.

**There are four main parts to rememember.**

1. Potions (framework agnostic style recipies)
2. CLI (setup your project + install potions)
3. Prebuilt Starter Components (React, Solid*, Vue*)
4. VScode Potion Extension (vscode snippets of all starter components)
