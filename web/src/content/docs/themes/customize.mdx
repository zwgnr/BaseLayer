## Custom

To make your own unique themes you can simply change the colors in the default theme installed, or extend the themes and create your own!

*css variables must be in the rgb format defined in the theme, i.e. *255 255 255*.

This is due to the way tailwind handles css variables, you can read more about it [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables)
