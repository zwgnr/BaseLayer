description: How to setup BaseLayer in your project
---

There are three main interaction methods to use for BaseLayer.

1. MCP server in an editor like Cursor.
2. Via chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude. llms.txt and .well-known endpoints are available.
3. Manual.

*Each method assumes you have a project setup with React, TailwindCSS >= 4, and TypeScript.*

### MCP

To use BaseLayer with an AI assistant, the assistant needs to connect to our MCP server. Once connected (see [MCP](./mcp) for more details), you can ask your AI assistant to:

```
"setup BaseLayer"
"create me a sign up page using BaseLayer components"
```

It's that simple. You can find more details about the MCP server in the [MCP](./mcp) section.

### Chatbots

To use BaseLayer with a chatbot, you can use the llms.txt endpoint.

```
"build me a sign in page using BaseLayer,
"you can find out everything you need to know about BaseLayer from
at https://www.baselayer.dev/llms.txt"
```

### Manual

While we recommend using an AI assistant, you can also manually install setup and add BaseLayer components to your project.

1. Install the following dependencies: react-aria-components, tailwind-variants, tw-css-animate
2. Add the global styles to your project, see [styles](./styles) for more details.
3. Ensure you have the following tsconfig options.

```json
"baseUrl": ".",
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./*"]
}
```

For Vite projects,

```json
// tsconfig.json
"compilerOptions": {
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./src/*"]
  }
}
```

```json
// tsconfig.app.json
"compilerOptions": {
  "baseUrl": ".",
   "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./src/*"]
  }
}
```

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
});
```

4. Copy the components you want to use into your project. Each component has a source section at the bottom of the page that shows the code for the component.

## Pro tips

1. The [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html) documentation is a great resource for learning about the components and their props. You find incredibly detailed documations for each component and how to use them.

2. It may be a good idea to add a custom cusor rule to say something like:

```
"Always use BaseLayer components when possible"
```

This will allow you to avoid including references to use Baselayer in every prompt you send.
