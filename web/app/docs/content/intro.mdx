## Key Features

- **AI-First Design** - Built-in MCP server for seamless AI assistant integration
- **Accessible by default** - Built on React Aria Components
- **Own your components** - Components you own and control, not a dependency
- **Component Registry** - Searchable catalog with metadata and versioning
- **Modern Stack** - React Aria Components + TailwindCSS + tailwind-variants + TypeScript
- **MCP Server** - Model Context Protocol server for AI-assisted development

## Getting Started

There are two main interaction methods to use for BaseLayer. Each one allows the LLM to: 
  - Search and discover components by name, category, or functionality
  - Get component installation code and instructions
  - Access component metadata and documentation

1. MCP server in an editor like Cursor.
2. Via chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude. llms.txt and .well-known endpoints are available.

#### MCP Server

To use BaseLayer with an AI assistant, the assistant needs to connect to our MCP server. Once connected (see [MCP](./mcp) for more details), you can ask your AI assistant to:

```
"setup BaseLayer"
"install the BaseLayer button component"  
"show me all form components"
```

It's that simple.

#### Chatbots

To use BaseLayer with a chatbot, you can use the llms.txt and .well-known endpoints.

```
"build me a sign in page using BaseLayer, 
you can find out everything you need to know about BaseLayer from
at https://www.baselayer.dev/llms.txt"
```

## Pro tips

It may be a good idea to add a custom cusor rule to say something like:

```
"always use BaseLayer components"
```

This will help the AI assistant consistently use BaseLayer components in your project.

## Manual Installation

While we recommend using an AI assistant, you can also manually install BaseLayer components. The source for all components is available under the source tab for each component.
