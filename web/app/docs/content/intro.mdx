## Key Features

- **Own your components** - Components you own and control, not a dependency
- **AI Native** - MCP server for seamless AI assistant integration
- **Variant-based design** - Powered by TailwindCSS and tailwind-variants for effortless customization
- **Accessible by default** - Built on battle-tested React Aria Components

## Stack

BaseLayer is built on top of the following technologies:

- [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Zero Config

BaseLayer embraces AI-assisted development with a zero config philosophy. No setup files, no build steps, no complex configuration. Just add components and start building. As AI handles the heavy lifting, you focus on creating great user experiences. Future customization options and upgrades will also be done config free.

## Design Philosophy

BaseLayer components are designed with intelligent grouping in mind. Many components like Accordion, RadioGroup, and CheckboxGroup include both individual and group functionality within the same component export. This approach provides:

- **Code reuse** - Shared styling and behavior between individual and group variants
- **Consistency** - Unified design language across single and grouped instances
- **Simplicity** - One component to learn instead of separate individual/group components
