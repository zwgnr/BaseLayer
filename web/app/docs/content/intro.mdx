## Zero-Config

A fundemental design goal of BaseLayer is to be zero-config. In the age of AI-assisted development, the goal is to make it as easy as possible to get started and use BaseLayer. This means no config files, no build steps, no setup. Just add the components and use them. Over time, there will be upgrade options and customization paths, but this will be done by leveraging AI instead of manual configuration.
