By default, BaseLayer uses Tailwind Variants for styling. Tailwind Variants is a library that allows you to create variants for your Tailwind CSS classes. This library also allows us to provide className overrides for every component without needed to install a separate library.

## Theming

Upon setup, global css variables are set for the theme. These variables are used to style the components.
